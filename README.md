Each template is designed to be plug-and-play: teams can onboard a new service by reusing the right template, without reinventing the wheel.

CI/CD Made Simple: Templates You Can Copy Today
From 1500+ Freestyle Jobs to 22 Reusable CI/CD Templates

We were drowning. Jenkins was running on freestyle mode, and every new service meant another job. Java upgrade? New job. Angular version bump? Another job. Before long, we had 1500+ freestyle jobs scattered across the system.
It looked like progress, but in reality it was chaos:
Developers struggled to maintain their own jobs.
SREs were firefighting broken builds.
Ops carried the overhead of managing a jungle of configurations.

CI/CD wasn't ignored intentionally - it was just easier to "spin up a new job" than to think about reusability. But that shortcut came at a cost: operational complexity, duplication, and wasted time.
The Turning Point: Templates
We decided enough was enough. Instead of creating jobs for every service, we built reusable CI/CD templates.
Now, instead of 1500+ freestyle jobs, we have just 20–22 templates that cover the majority of our stack:
React
Angular
Node.js
Next.js
Maven
Gradle
Allure Testing
ConceptJS Types

Each template is designed to be plug-and-play: teams can onboard a new service by reusing the right template, without reinventing the wheel.
The Impact
Consistency: Every pipeline follows the same structure.
Maintainability: Fixes in one template benefit all services.
Speed: New services onboard faster with minimal setup.
Reduced Overhead: Developers, Ops and SREs no longer babysit hundreds of jobs.

What used to be a sprawling mess of freestyle jobs is now a lean, scalable CI/CD ecosystem.
If you're still stuck in jenkins job hell, take this as your wake-up call. Don't let your pipelines become a graveyard of one-off jobs. Invest in templates, and you'll thank yourself when your team scales.
